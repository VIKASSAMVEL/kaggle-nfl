# üèà NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 Prediction - Competition Winning Strategy

## üéØ Competition Focus (Updated from Kaggle Pages)
**CRITICAL UPDATE**: This competition predicts **player movement trajectories** during pass plays, NOT general play outcomes.

**Objective**: Predict x,y coordinates of NFL players for every frame while the ball is in the air (post-QB release until catch/incompletion).

**Key Challenge**: Spatiotemporal trajectory prediction with 10 FPS tracking data during 0.5-4 second pass windows.

This document defines our enterprise-level strategy for achieving **TOP 1%** finish in this $50,000 competition.

## 2. Competition Objectives (Corrected)
- **PRIMARY GOAL**: Achieve **RMSE < 1.0** on player trajectory prediction (x,y coordinates) 
- **TARGET FINISH**: **TOP 3** (Prize money: $25k-$10k)
- **Technical Goals**:
  - Sub-pixel accuracy trajectory prediction using ensemble deep learning
  - Real-time inference capability for live NFL evaluation (Dec 4 - Jan 5)
  - Robust generalization across different player types and game situations
- **Innovation Focus**:
  - Physics-informed neural networks for realistic player movement
  - Multi-scale temporal attention for trajectory forecasting
  - Graph neural networks for player interaction modeling

---

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Primary User**: Kaggle competition participants (data scientists, engineers, NFL analytics enthusiasts).
- **Secondary Users**: NFL analysts, coaching staff (post-competition), academic researchers.
- **Decision Authority**: Kaggle leaderboard + evaluation metric.

## 4. Scope

### In-Scope
- Data ingestion from Kaggle datasets.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, smoothing sensor anomalies).
- Feature engineering from spatiotemporal tracking and contextual play data.
- Model experimentation (baseline ‚Üí advanced ML/DL).
- Cross-validation strategy ensuring no data leakage.
- Leaderboard submission pipeline.

### Out-of-Scope
- Real-time prediction deployment during live games.
- Integration with official NFL systems beyond the Kaggle scope.
- UI/UX dashboards for non-technical audiences.

## 5. Data Sources

| Dataset Component | Description | Usage |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Tracking Data** | Time-stamped x, y, speed, orientation, acceleration for all players & ball | Spatiotemporal features, relative motion, player interactions |
| **Play Metadata** | Down, distance, yard line, quarter, game clock, play type | Contextual embeddings, situational awareness |
| **Roster Data** | Player IDs, roles, attributes | Player-level generalization, clustering |
| **Game Data** | Game IDs, environmental context | Validation splits, environmental adjustments |
| **Train/Test Split** | Labeled outcomes vs. predictions required | Model training, leaderboard submission |

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Data Engineering
- Normalize and clean tracking data.
- Derive advanced features:
  - Relative distances & angles.
  - Velocities, accelerations, jerks.
  - Defender clustering and pressure zones.
  - Ball-carrier trajectory estimation.
- Merge contextual and roster datasets with play-level tracking.

### 6.2 Modeling
- **Baselines**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM.
- **Advanced ML**: XGBoost, CatBoost with engineered features.
- **Deep Learning**:
  - LSTMs / GRUs for sequence modeling.
  - Transformers for spatiotemporal attention.
  - Graph Neural Networks for player‚Äìplayer interactions.
- **Ensembling**:
  - Blend tree-based and deep models.
  - Use stacking/meta-learning.

### 6.3 Evaluation
- Metric: As defined by competition (e.g., RMSE, Log Loss, AUC).
- Cross-validation strategy:
  - Game-level splits.
  - Season or week-based temporal validation.
  - Avoid play-level leakage.

### 6.4 Pipeline
- Reproducible training + inference scripts.
- Configurable experiment tracking (e.g., Weights & Biases).
- Automated Kaggle submission script.

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reproducibility**: All experiments must run from raw data to final predictions via scripts/notebooks.
- **Scalability**: Code should handle large tracking datasets efficiently.
- **Performance**: Target top 5% leaderboard finish.
- **Robustness**: Guard against overfitting (public vs. private leaderboard gap).

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data leakage between plays/games | Invalid leaderboard score | Strict game-level CV |
| Overfitting to public LB | Drop in private LB | Ensemble robustness, out-of-fold validation |
| Computational limits | Slow iteration | Optimize feature extraction, use GPU acceleration |
| Sensor noise in tracking data | Feature unreliability | Data smoothing, anomaly detection |

---

## 9. Success Criteria
- **Baseline**: Achieve leaderboard score above median within 2 weeks.
- **Intermediate**: Consistently rank in top 20% with ensemble models.
- **Final**: Achieve top 5% leaderboard placement with robust generalization.
