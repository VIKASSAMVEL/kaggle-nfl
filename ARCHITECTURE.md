## 📊 Data Architecture

### Input Data Flow
```
NFL Raw Data (864MB, 39 files)
├── input_2023_w[01-18].csv (Pre-pass tracking)
├── output_2023_w[01-18].csv (Post-pass ground truth)
├── test_input.csv (Live evaluation data)
└── Supplementary Data (player stats, weather, field conditions)

↓ Data Pipeline ↓

Processed Features
├── Spatiotemporal Features (velocity, acceleration, relative positions)
├── Graph Features (player interactions, defensive coverage)
├── Physics Features (momentum, force vectors, collision predictions)
├── Contextual Features (play situation, field position, game state)
└── Engineered Targets (trajectory curves, landing zone predictions)
```

### Feature Store Architecture
```python
# High-Performance Feature Pipeline
class FeatureStore:
    - RawDataLoader: Parallel CSV processing with Dask
    - SpatialTransformer: Coordinate normalization and field mapping
    - TemporalAggregator: Multi-scale time windows (0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 2s)
    - GraphBuilder: Dynamic player interaction graphs
    - PhysicsEngine: Realistic motion constraints
    - FeatureCache: Redis/Parquet caching for fast iteration
```

## 🤖 Model Architecture

### 1. **Multi-Modal Ensemble System**

#### A. Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
```python
class PlayerTrajectoryPINN(nn.Module):
    """
    Physics-constrained trajectory prediction
    - Enforces realistic acceleration limits
    - Respects field boundaries and collision avoidance
    - Incorporates Newton's laws of motion
    """
```

#### B. Graph Attention Network (GAT)
```python
class PlayerInteractionGAT(nn.Module):
    """
    Models player-player interactions during pass plays
    - Dynamic graph construction per frame
    - Attention weights for defensive coverage
    - Multi-head attention for offense/defense strategies
    """
```

#### C. Transformer-XL Temporal Model
```python
class TrajectoryTransformerXL(nn.Module):
    """
    Long-range temporal dependencies
    - Extended context window for play development
    - Positional encoding for field coordinates
    - Multi-scale attention (frame, second, play level)
    """
```

#### D. Convolutional LSTM
```python
class SpatialConvLSTM(nn.Module):
    """
    Spatial pattern recognition in player formations
    - 2D convolutions over field positions
    - LSTM for temporal evolution of formations
    - Attention over key players (QB, targeted receiver)
    """
```

### 2. **Advanced Ensemble Strategy**
```python
class MetaLearningEnsemble:
    """
    Dynamic ensemble weights based on:
    - Play situation (down, distance, field position)
    - Player types (QB, RB, WR, defensive positions)
    - Game context (score, time remaining)
    - Model confidence scores
    """
```

## 🎛️ Training Infrastructure

### Cross-Validation Strategy
```python
# Temporal + Spatial Splits to prevent leakage
cv_strategy = {
    'temporal_split': 'by_week',  # Weeks 1-14 train, 15-18 val
    'game_level_split': 'by_game_id',  # Never split within games
    'player_generalization': 'unseen_players',  # Test on new players
    'situation_balance': 'stratified_by_down_distance'
}
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization
```python
# Bayesian Optimization with Optuna
search_space = {
    'learning_rate': [1e-5, 1e-2, 'log'],
    'batch_size': [32, 512, 'int'],
    'ensemble_weights': [0.1, 0.4, 'uniform'],
    'sequence_length': [10, 50, 'int'],
    'attention_heads': [4, 16, 'int'],
    'graph_layers': [2, 8, 'int']
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Real-Time Inference Pipeline
```python
class LivePredictionSystem:
    """
    Production-ready inference for live NFL games
    - <100ms latency per prediction
    - Fault-tolerant ensemble serving
    - Auto-scaling based on game load
    - Model versioning and rollback capability
    """
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Real-time model performance tracking
monitoring_metrics = {
    'prediction_latency': '<100ms p99',
    'model_drift': 'statistical_tests',
    'accuracy_degradation': 'sliding_window_rmse',
